# Dopewars 2D
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/154pinkchairs/dopewars2d)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/154pinkchairs/dopewars2d)

This game is being created with the intention of being the best Dopewars game ever. Initially it was meant to be just a text-based adventure,
but I've decided to use [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimeoshi/ebiten)

You are a small time drug dealer in the city of New York. After failing one job after another, you have decided to start a small business.
This game is going to feature:
- Traveling between districts
- Buying weapons
- Reputation and wanted level
- Combat, where you can deal melee damage, throw weapons and of course shoot guns at rival dealers, customers trying to rob you and law enforcers trying to arrest you.
- A bank, a loan shark and a hospital.
- Various random events.
