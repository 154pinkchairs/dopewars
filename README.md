# <span style="color:red"> This project is not currently maintained. I hope to revive it someday, although it'll probably be a rewrite from scratch due to the design flaws in the original project, the time that has passed since I did anything on it and the amount of breaking changes in Ebiten. sorry

This game is being created with the intention of being the best Dopewars game ever. Initially it was meant to be just a text-based adventure,
but I've decided to use [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimeoshi/ebiten)

You are a small time drug dealer in the city of New York. After failing one job after another, you have decided to start a small business.
This game is going to feature:
- Traveling between districts
- Buying weapons
- Reputation and wanted level
- Combat, where you can deal melee damage, throw weapons and of course shoot guns at rival dealers, customers trying to rob you and law enforcers trying to arrest you.
- A bank, a loan shark and a hospital.
- Various random events.

Roadmap:
- [x] Create main menu
- [x] Declare base game mechanics
- [x] World assets â€“ use [iso tiles by Screaming Brain Studios (public domain)](https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/)
- [x] Entity assets: WIP
